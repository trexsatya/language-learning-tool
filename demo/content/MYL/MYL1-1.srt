17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,917
She should be here in a few minutes

Meanwhile, perhaps you'd
care to wait in the classroom

19

Just go down the corridor, turn left at
the bottom and wait in room number five

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,551
- You're a man - Yes

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,433
This is most unsatisfactory! This
won't do at all

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,312
l assure you my credentials are impeccable

40
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,274
Academically perhaps, but l'm talking about sex

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,551
l also assure you that my
morals are perfectly respectable too

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,638
l'm referring to the fact that you are a man

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,309
l distinctly requested the Local
Authority to send me a woman teacher

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,637
Especially after the unfortunate
incident involving Mr. Warburton

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,398
- Mr. Warburton? - Yes

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,273
He was teaching English to
foreign students last term

47
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,915
l'm afraid he only lasted
a month, then he departed

48
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,271
- Dead? - Demented

49
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,510
Yes, the strain was too much for him

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,632
Typical of the male sex! No stamina

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,630
He seemed to be able to cope at
first, but one day he just snapped

52
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,593
- lt was really quite disgusting
- Really? What did he do?

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,430
Climbed out of the classroom
window and on to the roof

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,233
Took all his clothes off and
stood there stark naked

55
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,959
Singing ''l've got a lovely bunch of coconuts''

56
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,318
How distressing! Still you
musn't worry on my account

57
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,317
l'm not likely to climb out
of the classroom window

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,509
l know you aren't

59
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,598
- Thank you for your confidence
- lt's got nothing to do with confidence

60
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,908
We've had the window frames nailed down

61
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,512
How very thoughtful! Well, l

62

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:56,908
- You lag trees? - Si, 1 Jeentonic,
2 whisky, coka tree laggers

180
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,317
- Three lagers - Si

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,158
- You work in a bar - Bar, si

182
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,431
- Well, Mr. Brown - Yes thank you

183
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,630
Apart from one attempted
murder and a possible race riot

184
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,951
l think we're coping reasonably well

185
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,909
l've come to inform you about the
registration fees for the students

186
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,913
lt's 5 pounds per head!

187
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,317
l'll be grateful if u would collect the money
and bring it to my office in your tea break

188
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,589
Right, l'll do that

189
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,393
Well we have one thing to be grateful for anyway

190
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,909
Sex won't be rearing its ugly little head

191
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,514
l beg your pardon?

192
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,315
From past experience, it isn't
race or religion that causes problems

193
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,238
lt's usually the presence of some foreign beauty

194
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,914
Jealousies, intrigues - all that sort of thing

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,197
Yes, well looking at my class, l dont think
we'll be too bothered with anything like that

196
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,953
l come to learn English 'Ave
l come to ze right place?

197
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,470
Enter

198
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,998
- Mrs Courtney - Miss

199
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,238
Miss! l've just brought the
registration fees for the students

200
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,959
- Good! Now how many students have you? - Nine

201
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,312
- So there's 45 pounds in here
- That depends on the rate of exchange

202
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,873
l don't quite follow you

203
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,477
Not all of them had 5 pounds in English money

204
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,639
So l collected 29,50 in Sterling and the
rest is made up of 2000 yen, 3000 lira

205
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,357
250 pesetas, 75 drachmas, 50
francs and 12 deutchmarks

206
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,632
According to this morning's financial paper,
that should give us a profit of 1045,5 pounds

207
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,996
Then l suggest you take it to the bank in
the morning and convert it into English currency

208
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,235
Right, l'll do that

209
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,349
- By the way, how's the femme
fatale? - Ah, yes! Danielle

210
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,471
At the moment, she's in the tea
room with ltaly, Spain and Greece

211
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,352
Trying to establish diplomatic relations

212
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,909
- l hope she's not going to cause any
bother - Oh no, l'm sure she won't

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,915
- Look, l am going to sitta here - No,

- Who is gonna be stopping me? - Me

Yourself? You think you're tough! Come outside

220
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,955
Hokay

221
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,558
- Where are you going? - We

222
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,352

l see! And l suppose it's got nothing to do
with the fact that Danielle is sitting here too

231
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,950
She is?

232
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,232

00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,511
- l am from Pakistan - Yes but now use 'you are'

304
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,519
But l cannot say you are from
Pakistan because you are not, are you?

305
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,912
- Repeat after me - you are English

Sit down please! Quiet!

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,395
Until you all get your text books! But what

You look a trifle under the weather

321
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,313
- Job getting you down already?
- No, no l'm fine! Never felt better

322
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,272
- There's just one thing though - Yes

323
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,233
That window you nailed down! The
one Mr. Warburton climbed out of

324
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,270
What about it?

325
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,153
l think l ought to put a few more nails in it
